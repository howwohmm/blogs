They can be used to test Stripe functionality, collaborate more easily, and experiment with new features without affecting your live integration. When testing in a sandbox, the payments you create aren’t processed by card networks or payment providers, and funds aren’t moved. If you want to learn more about Sandboxes, start by taking a [tour](https://beta.stripe.dev/?step=sandboxes&utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=e0a4&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_43c9&utm_content=bf22&utm_term=6827eb11f9c7). If you’d like to be one of the first users, fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/VzhuEpWbhEFoHacP8)—we’ll enable Sandboxes for your account. And if you want to make our product team’s day, please share feedback by creating a new [post](https://insiders.stripe.dev/c/sandboxes/6?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=83c4&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_4ffa&utm_content=bd5e&utm_term=e37765e73c85) in the Sandbox category on [Stripe Insiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=a421&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_49b4&utm_content=96e6&utm_term=f613e0d7ad64).\n\n— Nilofer Rajpurkar Product Manager, Stripe\n\n\n![](/images/2024-06-dev-digest/sandboxes.png)\n\n\n### Updates\n\n**VS Code extension GitHub Copilot preview:** Stripe is one of the first GitHub Copilot Extensions. We’re bringing the knowledge of Stripe Docs—along with the ability to update, create, and understand your codebase—into the most widely adopted AI developer tools. Join the [beta](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJBbS_WQi7X-dd2CtQ6AUAJJPQV3mOXA3AbpofLw5chsCLjA/viewform).\n\n**Apps on Devices (AoD) general availability:** For all Terminal users in 23 countries, Apps on Devices is now [generally available](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/overview?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=121a&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_47df&utm_content=88c8&utm_term=13bacee40cbe). You can now run custom Android-based POS (or other compatible Android applications) directly on the Stripe Reader S700. \n\n**Onchain Summer Buildathon:** Stripe is sponsoring the Payments track for Coinbase’s [Onchain Summer Buildathon](https://wallet.coinbase.com/nft/mint/buildathon). [Get involved](https://base.mirror.xyz/iYQH5yxgH976gUmrYfoeyVpe5SJtiR8r2t10Psr1_-U) from now until June 30 to help demonstrate how easy it is for anyone to get on chain. \n\n**Stripe’s database infrastructure:** Learn more about the [technical details](https://stripe.com/blog/how-stripes-document-databases-supported-99.999-uptime-with-zero-downtime-data-migrations?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=fd10&utm_campaign=US/CA_44e7&utm_content=92ee&utm_term=0382e52de5bf) of Stripe’s database infrastructure, which is the key foundation supporting API uptime greater than 99.999%.\n\n![](/images/2024-06-dev-digest/db-infra.png)\n\n\n**Community**  \nWe recently met some of you in San Francisco, Dublin, and London, and we have another [meetup](https://lu.ma/ph5wyetr) scheduled for June 20 in Berlin. Beyond that, we’re putting together an ambitious schedule of community events for the second half of this year. More details to follow, and we’re excited to meet many more of you in person.\n\nWe’re also working on open-sourcing the demos we showed at [Stripe Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ZStXOXAFo), so you can get access to sample code and tinker with different use cases that might help with your own implementations.\n\nFinally, please join the conversation on [Stripe Insiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=a421&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_49b4&utm_content=96e6&utm_term=f613e0d7ad64)—we’d love your feedback on our updated [webhooks experience](https://insiders.stripe.dev/t/feedback-request-updated-webhooks-experience/667?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=97b8&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_4115&utm_content=82fb&utm_term=90319e409c1b), and our design approach to a new [Replay API](https://insiders.stripe.dev/t/give-the-team-your-feedback-we-are-designing-a-new-replay-api-for-webhook-events/1024?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=fb65&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_4b13&utm_content=bfe3&utm_term=1306ad57e94e) for webhook events.\n\n\n— The Stripe team\n","authorBio":"","additionalResources":[{"title":"Subscribe to Stripe Developers on YouTube.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/stripedevelopers\""},{"title":"Follow us at @Stripedev on twitter for updates and answers to your developer questions.","url":"https://twitter.com/stripedev"},{"title":"Sign up for the Developer Digest.","url":"https://go.stripe.global/dev-digest"},{"title":"Join the Stripe Discord server to chat live with other developers.","url":"https://discord.com/invite/RuJnSBXrQn"},{"title":"Join Stripe Insiders to try the latest features and provide direct feedback to the teams that build them.","url":"https://insiders.stripe.dev"}],"relatedArticles":[{"slug":"stripe-developer-digest-august-2024-workbench-is-now-available-to-everyone","title":"Stripe Developer Digest (August 2024): Workbench is now available to everyone","summary":"Test Stripe functionality in an isolated environment","authors":["Stripe Team"],"date":"2024-08-30","type":"Blog","topics":["Dev Digest"],"artConfig":{"ampX":2,"ampY":2.0936337963955425,"aspectRatio":1.5242133042669057,"axis":"xy","lump":3.098375770798168,"count":178.60000000000002,"freq":3.785997393314164,"isDial":false,"isLineart":false,"isRing":true,"isSpiral":false,"isBalls":false,"isMatrix":false,"left":0,"kaleids":2.250000000000001,"mouseX":0.3350694444444444,"mouseY":0.4223790322580645,"noise":0,"scale":0.4193887555560054,"top":0,"twirl":0.006193707110889813,"twist":0,"velocity":0.3,"shape":"rect"}},{"slug":"simple-error-handling-strategies-with-stripe-workbench","title":"Simple error handling strategies with Stripe Workbench","summary":"With Workbench, developers now have a bird’s-eye view of their integration which shows many potential issues in one place.
