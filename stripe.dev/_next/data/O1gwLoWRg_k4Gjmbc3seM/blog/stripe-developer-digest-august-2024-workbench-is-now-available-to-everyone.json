They all told us the same thing: while they love our docs and code snippets, they wish they could get guidance and debugging tools in situ, as they build, without having to bounce between various tabs.  In particular, developers want to maximize their flow state. The conditions to achieve flow state are well-known: knowing what to do, being free from distractions, and having a clear challenge along with the right set of skills and tools.  Stripe Workbench is our new home for developers within the Dashboard that helps you debug, monitor, and grow your Stripe integration. Workbench provides an at-a-glance summary of your integration’s behavior so you can explore your account’s API and event history, prototype and build new integrations, and receive critical account alerts. It’s now available for everyone, on every Dashboard surface, with a single keystroke. As you’re building, Workbench highlights errors and helps you resolve them, and it recommends ways to improve the efficiency of your integration.  If you want to learn more about Workbench, start by reading our [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench?utm_medium=marketing-email&utm_source=2df1&utm_campaign=GLOBAL_4d7b&utm_content=a625&utm_term=bccd88b40bf8).
