Additionally, you have the ability to control access to these sandboxes, defining who can use them. \n\nHow you implement sandboxes can make all the difference. It’s important to decide on a sandbox strategy that best suits your organization's development approach and team size. This blog provides a comprehensive guide to choosing the right sandbox strategy based on your organizational context. \n\n## Getting Started\n\nAn admin user can grant access to multiple accounts, with each Stripe live account allowing for up to five sandboxes. To access sandboxes from your Stripe dashboard, navigate to the account picker menu in the upper left corner. \n\n![image1](/images/choosing-the-right-sandbox-strategy/1.png)\n\nTo create a new sandbox, choose the **\\+Create** button from the Sandboard Dashboard UI. Each sandbox must have a name, which you can modify after creation. You have the option to copy settings from your live account. For detailed information on which attributes are copied, refer to the [sandbox settings page](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/sandbox-settings) in the documentation.\n\n![image2](/images/choosing-the-right-sandbox-strategy/2.png)\n\nAfter creating your sandboxes, you can view the complete list through the account dropdown or by visiting [https://dashboard.stripe.com/sandboxes](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sandboxes). From this page, you can delete sandboxes \\- simply choose the trash can icon to remove a sandbox when it is no longer needed. \n\nWith your sandboxes ready, it’s important to consider how to best use them based on your organizational structure and development goals. Choosing the right sandbox setup can influence the effectiveness of your testing process. By evaluating different strategies that align with your team's size, workflow, and specific needs, you can optimize your testing environments. \n\nThe following sections explore various sandbox setup examples, ranging from a single project focus for startups to department-specific arrangements for larger organizations.\n\n## Single Project Focus\n\nFor startups and small teams, the development landscape is often characterized by a singular focus – bringing a product to market quickly and efficiently. With limited resources and tight timelines, every minute spent on testing is crucial for accelerating development. In this environment, dedicated sandboxes become pivotal assets for small teams. Start by allocating your five available sandboxes to various stages of the development cycle. This segmented approach not only increases efficiency but also enhances the clarity of the testing process.\n\n![image3](/images/choosing-the-right-sandbox-strategy/3.png)\n\n**Development Sandbox** is the first stage where new features and code changes are tested. Here, developers can explore new functionality, resolve bugs, and refine user interfaces without worrying about repercussions on the live environment. Each change can be scrutinized in isolation, enabling developers to experiment freely while still adhering to deadlines.\n\nNext comes the **Integration Testing Sandbox**, where the focus shifts to ensuring that all components work seamlessly together. It’s one thing to have an independent feature functioning correctly, but it’s another to confirm that the integration with other systems, such as payment gateways, databases, and back-end services, operates as intended. With a dedicated sandbox for this phase, teams can methodically test interactions in a safe environment, quickly identifying and addressing issues that may arise during integration.\n\nAfter integration is [User Acceptance Testing (UAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing#User_acceptance_testing), a critical stage where actual users or stakeholders validate whether the product meets their requirements and expectations. A dedicated **UAT Sandbox** provides a realistic setting that closely mirrors the live environment, enabling teams to gather meaningful feedback. This stage is not just about functionality; it’s about delivering an experience that resonates with users, making it essential to test under conditions that simulate actual usage.\n\nLastly, two **Spare Sandboxes** can be used for overflow needs, accommodating unexpected testing scenarios that arise throughout development. Whether it’s a sudden requirement change or the need for quick tests on new integrations, having these extra environments ensures that the team can respond agilely without disruption.\n\nBy maintaining a focused approach with dedicated sandboxes, small teams can simplify their development process. Gain clarity in testing, minimizing the confusion and chaos often associated with overlapping testing environments. In doing so, you can quickly deliver high-quality products and set a solid foundation for future scalability and development within the organization.\n\n## Department-specific and Rotating Sandboxes\n\nIn larger organizations or established businesses, the complexity of projects often necessitates a more structured approach to testing. With multiple departments, such as development, quality assurance (QA), marketing, and product management all contributing to a product’s lifecycle, overlapping efforts can create confusion and inefficiency. This is where department-specific and rotating sandboxes come into play, providing a streamlined and organized way to manage testing activities.\n\n![image4](/images/choosing-the-right-sandbox-strategy/4.png)\n\nThe first step in this strategy is to allocate specific sandboxes to different departments. Each department can have its own dedicated sandbox tailored to its unique workflow and testing needs. For instance, the development team may use one sandbox for feature testing, ensuring that new code integrates seamlessly with existing functionalities. Meanwhile, the QA team can use another sandbox focused on stress testing and performance evaluation, validating that the application performs under varying conditions.\n\nThis separation allows for clear delineation of responsibilities and activities. Each team can work independently without the risk of impacting another’s testing environment. Developers can freely make changes and experiment with new features while QA conducts thorough tests to catch bugs and usability issues. \n\nOnce your team concludes your testing phase, the sandbox can be deleted, with a new one created and reassigned to another department for their next project or testing cycle. This provides fresh environments that can accommodate the new testing needs of different departments.\n\nDepartment-specific and rotating sandboxes create a dynamic and organized testing framework for larger organizations. With the ability to adapt quickly to new needs and integrate shared learnings, your development team is better equipped to deliver high-quality products in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\n## **Iterative Testing and Feedback Loops**\n\nAgile methodologies prioritize flexibility, with iterative testing and feedback loops. By using Stripe sandboxes in this manner, development teams can expedite their delivery processes.\n\nAt the core of this strategy is the principle of rapid prototyping. By using dedicated sandboxes for specific iterations of a project, teams can test new features, functionality, and changes to the application without the fear of disrupting the live environment. This sandbox approach allows developers to experiment with various configurations and solutions. Each sandbox iteration is a chance to prototype ideas quickly, validate them with controlled testing, and gather immediate data on performance and usability.\n\n![image5](/images/choosing-the-right-sandbox-strategy/5.png)\n\nNext comes the significance of real-time feedback mechanisms. As developers work in their sandboxes, incorporating feedback loops ensures that insights are captured at every stage of the development process. Stakeholders, including product managers and user representatives, can interact with sandboxes during designated review phases, providing critical feedback that informs further development. This continuous stream of feedback allows teams to make meaningful adjustments throughout the lifecycle of a project, rather than waiting until the end to identify issues.\n\nThe advantages of an iterative approach extend beyond just testing new features; they foster a culture of continuous improvement. By integrating feedback at each stage, teams can learn and adapt, refining not just the product but also their development processes. For example, if a feature isn’t meeting user expectations, rather than remaining in a lengthy feedback and revision loop, developers can quickly implement changes in the sandbox, retest, and validate in real time. This leads to a faster pace of improvement, where products not only survive but thrive in user environments.\n\nWith each iteration documented, the knowledge gained from real-time testing becomes invaluable. Teams can maintain logs of what changes were made, what worked, and what didn’t, creating a repository of insights that guide future iterations. This clear record not only serves to educate new team members but also allows for informed decision-making in subsequent projects.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStripe sandboxes offers a new way for developers to test their Stripe integrations in an isolated environment. Sandboxes reduce the need to create multiple accounts to test different features during the development phase, and offer greater control and granularity over the permissions of each test environment. \n\nThe flexibility of creation, deletion, and granular permissions lends sandboxes to multiple implementation approaches. Smaller development teams or startups may work best with a single project approach, Larger organizations may be more suited to a department or rotating sandbox strategy. Alternatively you may choose an approach that is based on your development methodology. By tailoring your strategy to your organizational context you can maximize the benefits of these environments. With proper management and usage, sandboxes become a vital resource in your development toolkit, helping you navigate challenges and deliver quality products faster than ever.\n\nTo learn more about developing applications with Stripe, visit our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/stripedevelopers).\n","authorBio":"","additionalResources":[{"title":"Subscribe to Stripe Developers on YouTube.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/stripedevelopers\""},{"title":"Follow us at @Stripedev on twitter for updates and answers to your developer questions.","url":"https://twitter.com/stripedev"},{"title":"Sign up for the Developer Digest.","url":"https://go.stripe.global/dev-digest"},{"title":"Join the Stripe Discord server to chat live with other developers.","url":"https://discord.com/invite/RuJnSBXrQn"},{"title":"Join Stripe Insiders to try the latest features and provide direct feedback to the teams that build them.","url":"https://insiders.stripe.dev"}],"relatedArticles":[{"slug":"avoiding-test-mode-tangles-with-stripe-sandboxes","title":"Avoiding test mode tangles with Stripe Sandboxes","summary":"Discover how to create independent testing environments with Stripe Sandboxes, streamline your development through GitHub automation, and prioritize the security of your API keys to enhance your payment integration process.","authors":["Ben Smith"],"date":"2024-09-16","type":"Blog","topics":["Sandboxes"],"artConfig":{"ampX":1.1642105275795096,"ampY":0.21234603378855432,"aspectRatio":1.791098642361734,"axis":"y","lump":0.7446210340261474,"count":109.99999999999999,"freq":3.0281107682703468,"isDial":false,"isLineart":false,"isRing":false,"isSpiral":false,"isBalls":false,"isMatrix":false,"left":0,"kaleids":2.5900000000000083,"mouseX":0.6134259259259259,"mouseY":0.7247983870967742,"noise":0,"scale":1.1986845318092938,"top":2,"twirl":0.005405418018509103,"twist":4.438000000000008,"velocity":0.5109999999999996,"shape":"ellipse"}},{"slug":"bringing-your-stripe-objects-to-life-with-workbench","title":"Bringing your Stripe objects to life with Workbench","summary":"This post shows how to use the Stripe Workbench Inspector to examine the lifecycle of a PaymentIntent object.","authors":["Ben Smith"],"date":"2024-08-29","type":"Blog","topics":["Workbench","Payment Intents"],"artConfig":{"ampX":1.720000000000003,"ampY":1,"aspectRatio":1,"axis":"x","lump":0,"count":25,"freq":1,"isDial":false,"isLineart":false,"isRing":false,"isSpiral":false,"isBalls":true,"isMatrix":true,"left":-120,"mouseX":0.5422453703703703,"mouseY":0.5581668625146886,"noise":3.2309999999999084,"scale":1.323999999999992,"top":-50,"twirl":0.06299999999999983,"twist":15.419999999999984,"velocity":1,"shape":"ellipse"}}]},"authors":[{"name":"Ben Smith","slug":"ben-smith","profile":"Ben is a Staff Developer Advocate at Stripe, based in the UK.
